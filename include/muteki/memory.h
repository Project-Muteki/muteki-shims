 * @brief Memory management API.
 * @details
 * In Besta RTOS, heap memory management is entirely done in the OS kernel.
 * All applications share a single heap managed by the OS and can be accessed
 * through the malloc series API. Conventional address-space based heap memory
 * management such as sbrk() is not supported due to the absence of MMU support
 * in the OS kernel.
 *
 * The simplest way to get heap memory support in a custom libc is to redirect
 * malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free() to the corresponding functions
 * provided here.
